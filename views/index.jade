        h2 Austin Code Camp 2012 Lightning Talks
        h3.accent-blue Your talk:
        p
           | You should create a talk that lasts for at most 5 minutes. You can
           | project from your laptop if you feel it would benefit your talk,
           | but it’s definitely not a requirement.  There should be some sort
           | of whiteboard in the room that you can use.  A hint or two for a
           | successful lightning talk: Don’t try to cover too much! Consider
           | highlighting a just single idea, or perhaps one or two favorite
           | techniques. Keep the scope small and tightly focused so what you
           | do cover is enough to communicate something. You don’t have to
           | fully teach something, in a lightning talk, it’s enough to give
           | the listeners a taste so they might be inspired to find out more
           | on their own.  It’s okay to give a lightning talk if you have
           | never presented before - you have something to say, and we’d
           | love to hear it!
        h3.accent-blue How the session will work:
        p
           | At the beginning of the session, we will check to make sure
           | everyone who said they would give a talk is present, and if it
           | looks like there will be any leftover presenting spots, see if
           | anyone else wants to present. At that time, we’ll finalize and
           | write down the talk order so presenters can get ready before their
           | talk.
        p
           | If you’re using the projector, plan to head up to the front one
           | talk before yours. We hope to have two projectors in the room so
           | you can work on setting up while the prior talk is going on. That
           | way we can keep the downtime between talks to a minimum. 
        p
           | We will have a timer of some kind to keep everyone honest with the
           | length of their talks, and we’ll make sure you know how much time
           | you have left. We’re not going to yank you off by the collar
           | mid-word, but if your time is up, finish up as soon as possible so
           | we have enough time for everyone.
        h3.accent-blue How to submit a talk: 
        p
           | On the day of the conference, we’ll have a board where you can
           | sign up to give a lightning talk, or talks. You can sign up for
           | multiple lightning talks, but if we have too many talks, we’ll move
           | to one talk per person to give everyone a chance.  The board will
           | be up in the morning somewhere prominent when the conference first
           | starts, and the lightning talks will be the last session(s) of the
           | day. 
        h3.accent-blue Questions:
        p

           | href="http://twitter.com/#!ajepst">@ajepst</a> if you have
           | any questions on the above or would like to help.
